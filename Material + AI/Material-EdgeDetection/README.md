## Sample Visual Results â€“ YOLOv8 & YOLOv11

This project includes visual detection results from two versions of the YOLO model: **YOLOv8** and **YOLOv11**.  
The following sample images demonstrate the effectiveness of segmentation in identifying **sharp-edged** and **smooth-edged** materials moving on a conveyor belt.

- The ** two images** (`Sample1` & `Sample2`) are outputs of **YOLOv8**, which provide bounding box detection with confidence scores.
- The **remaining images** (`Sample11` to `Sample15`) are results of **YOLOv11** segmentation models, showing not only bounding boxes but also **precise shape segmentation masks**, enhancing the understanding of material contours and form.

These results are part of a broader intelligent material sorting system, which can be found in the following repositories:

> All datasets used in this project have been exported in **three formats**:  
**COCO**, **YOLOv8**, and **YOLOv11**, ensuring flexibility and compatibility with various modern deep learning pipelines.
